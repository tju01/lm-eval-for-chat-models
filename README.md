This repository describes a proposal for changes in lm-evaluation-harness to integrate benchmarks for instruction-finetuned/chat language models.
While lm-evaluation-harness is often used for these models, the currently implemented benchmarks are primarily designed around base models.
To integrate better support for chat language models, I propose the following changes:
1. Support for [**chat templates**](chat-templates.md) to evaluate the model in the same way it is fine-tuned and used later in practice.
2. [**Larger focus on zero-shot**](zero-shot.md): None of these benchmarks use a few-shot context. All of them are evaluated using a zero-shot setting. Again, this is also how the models are mostly used later in practice.
3. [**More flexible tasks**](more-flexible-tasks.md): MT-Bench in particular is very different from the existing tasks in lm-evaluation-harness. In addition to the zero-shot setting with chat templates, it also uses multi-turn conversations and is model-graded by GPT-4. Integrating this benchmark requires supporting a more flexible task structure.
4. [**Inference modifications**](inference-modifications.md): Most of the current tasks in lm-evaluation-harness only consider a few output tokens per prompt. In contrast, these benchmarks generate a few hundred tokens. Running these benchmarks using HF transformers is very slow and the WizardLM group has also integrated vLLM in their evaluations.
